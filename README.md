In this lab, we implemented a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for binary and multiclass classification using nonlinear kernels. A polynomial kernel of degree 3 was used to capture nonlinear relationships, and the optimization problem was solved using cvxopt. The SVM was extended to multiclass classification using two strategies: One-vs-Rest (OvR) and One-vs-One (OvO). OvR achieved an accuracy of 91%, while OvO performed slightly better at 94%. Hyperparameter tuning for the regularization parameter C identified C = 1.0 as optimal for OvR strategies, and C= 10.0 for OvO, balancing margin size and classification errors.

Confusion matrices were generated to analyze model performance, revealing that most classes were correctly classified, with some confusion between visually similar digits (e.g., 4 and 9). These matrices provided valuable insights into areas for improvement. Overall, the SVM demonstrated strong performance on the MNIST dataset, achieving high accuracy and effectively handling multiclass classification.

Future work could explore other kernels (e.g., RBF), approximation methods for scalability, and ensemble techniques to further enhance performance. This lab highlighted the versatility and effectiveness of SVMs for complex classification tasks.
